Finished the gem and updated the template repo, but didn't go down the path of
working on UI as planned. Instead, I started a new repo from the template so I
can play around with PixiJS and perhaps build the HackTile prototype more
quickly. Got that set up and deploying to https://hacktile.kranzky.com
