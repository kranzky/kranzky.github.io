I've been reading about deep work, and I've been toying with HackTile again.

I think I should do both.

This is just a test post. I am going to delete it.

But it's important to get some content in.

{% highlight c %}
// http://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/index.php

#include "engine.h"
#include "game.h"
#include "editor.h"

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  bool ready = true;
  ready = ready && CLK_init_engine();
  ready = ready && CLK_init_game();
  if (ready)
    CLK_loop();
  CLK_free_game();
  CLK_engine();
  return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
{% endhighlight c %}

That's the lot!
