Easy morning. Decided I'd take my foot off the accelerator at work until design
and requirements sort themselves out. Don't want to rework any of the backend.
Planned an easy day of fixing a few issues and getting some chores done:
banking, cleaning, shopping and a blood donation. But they cajoled me to donate
platelets instead of blood---I was reticent to do so due to my bad experience
last year---but they were very kind and careful and it all went well.
Unfortunately it was super-busy, and so that ended up taking a large chunk out
of my day. Even worse, returned home dead tired, a combination I think of
deciding to work less intensely and the loss of blood. Mooching around in the
afternoon; mum and dad over with shepherd's pie for dinner. Yum. Too worn out in
the evening to code; vegged out in front of the TV before having an early night.
