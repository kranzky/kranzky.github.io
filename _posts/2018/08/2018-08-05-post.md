Dzung took Jack to North Shore, and Eliza to tennis. I got the washing on, then
Brendan and Finlay over for a cuppa with some banana bread they'd made. Chatted
for a while---Fin is doing great at footy and Brendan is working with The Wall
Street Journal---then they took the old TV and DVR. Quick shower and Dzung back
home to pick me up to go to Van and Kiet's for oxtail soup. Lingered after lunch
chatting while the kids played. Home via Mt. Lawley to pick up a box from Get
Chunky to take to dinner tonight.
