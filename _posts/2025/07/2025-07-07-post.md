I have mostly finished [Rhyme+Reason](https://rnr.kranzky.com). Simple Analytics
reveals that we're getting close between 50 and 100 players per day, and I've
generated six months worth of puzzles. So now it'll be a case of monitoring and
tweaking and hand-crafting puzzles when I feel inspired to do so. It's been fun!

Have mostly recovered from my third bout of COVID. A week spent sitting or lying
down most of the time and not exercising or bike riding wasn't fun, but I made
the most of it and focused on getting some projects completed.

School holidays have just started and the weather is cold and rainy.
