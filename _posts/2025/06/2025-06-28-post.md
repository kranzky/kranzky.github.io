Well times are crazy. AI is crazy. Here are my New Year's resolutions:

* Keep an online project diary, updated weeky
* Ride the Munda Biddi
* Workout daily
* Do a second podcast season, The Movies of 1985
* Read 36 books
* Ride 2500km
* Use an AI to code something
* Release four projects:
  1. Vertext
  2. Rhyme+Reason
  3. Gumshoe
  4. Creatures of the N-Simplex

So far I've failed on the weekly project diary, but I've done everything else!
For riding I'm far ahead, having cracked 2000km already. And AI coding has
accelerated since the start of the year; both Vertext and Rhyme+Reason were both
mostly completed with AI!
