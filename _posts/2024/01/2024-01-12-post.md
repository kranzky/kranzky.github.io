Well, I still haven't been sued by PicRights. They did reduce their requests for
damages by 1/3 but it's ridiculous that they expect me to pay anything. So it's
just a case of wait-and-see for me. What a horrible way for a business to make
money; going for the small-fry who are easier pushovers.

Anyway, new year and things are going well. Eliza is off on a month-long holiday
around the world before she starts Uni. We'll miss her, but I'm sure it will be
a memorable experience for her.

I've also started a podcast with Talbs, called
[The Movies of 1999](https://1999.kranzky.com). It's a side-project of my goal
in 2024 of hosting a movie night every Sunday to watch a movie from 1999. It's
off to a good start, and I hope we can keep the motivation and release all 52
episodes. Only time will tell!
