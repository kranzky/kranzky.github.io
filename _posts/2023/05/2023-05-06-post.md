It's been quite a week for me! After a long break, my kids returned to school and my daughter, Eliza, has been stressing about her upcoming tests. It's tough to see her worry like this, but I'm confident she'll do great. Meanwhile, my wife Dana got sick and had an emergency gall bladder removal. She had to miss out on a Bali trip with friends, which was disappointing, but we're just grateful she's okay.

Despite the rain and cold weather, I've been making good progress at work. We have a big project milestone coming up next week, and I've been putting in extra hours to make sure everything is ready. On Monday, I caught up with an old friend, Wil, after a month-long break. It was great to see him and we had a lot to catch up on.

In the evenings, my kids and I have been watching Sweet Tooth together, which they've really been enjoying. But the highlight of the week had to be the dinner I made in the style of an anime we've been watching, "Campfire Cooking in Another World Using My Unique Skill." I prepared a fantastic steak dinner, and it turned out just as delicious as I had hoped.

All in all, it's been a week of ups and downs, but we've made it through. It's important to take each day as it comes and appreciate the little things, like spending quality time with loved ones and trying new things in the kitchen.
